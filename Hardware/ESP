1. Processing Power and Architecture
    ESP32-S2:
        Single-core Xtensa LX7 processor.
        Clock speed: up to 240 MHz.
        Suitable for moderate processing tasks.
    ESP32-S3:
        Dual-core Xtensa LX7 processors.
        Clock speed: up to 240 MHz per core.
        Offers more computing power, ideal for demanding tasks like AI and multimedia.
2. AI and Machine Learning Features
    ESP32-S2:
        No dedicated AI acceleration or vector instructions.
        Less suited for AI/ML workloads.
    ESP32-S3:
        Includes vector instructions for AI/ML acceleration.
        Optimized for machine learning tasks such as neural network inference.
3. Memory
    ESP32-S2:
        320 KB SRAM and 128 KB ROM.
        Limited PSRAM support compared to S3.
    ESP32-S3:
        512 KB SRAM and 384 KB ROM.
        Better support for external PSRAM, allowing up to 16 MB.
4. Connectivity
    ESP32-S2:
        Integrated Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n).
        No native Bluetooth support.
    ESP32-S3:
        Integrated Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n).
        Native Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy (BLE) support.
5. GPIO and Peripherals
    ESP32-S2:
        43 GPIO pins with fewer peripherals.
        USB 1.1 OTG (supports both Host and Device modes).
    ESP32-S3:
        44 GPIO pins, more flexible peripheral options.
        USB 1.1 OTG support.
        Enhanced features like better LCD and camera interface support.
6. Power Consumption
    Both chips are optimized for low-power operation, but the ESP32-S2 may consume slightly less power due to its single-core design.
7. Use Cases
    ESP32-S2:
        Ideal for simple IoT devices requiring Wi-Fi connectivity and moderate processing.
        Suitable for projects where power consumption is critical.
    ESP32-S3:
      Better for AI/ML applications, multimedia, and more complex IoT projects.
      Perfect for tasks requiring both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
