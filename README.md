# NeuraVis
The project aims to utilize Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor, analyze, and interpret brainwave activity for applications in neuroscience, mental health, and human-computer interaction. 
# Hardware indeed

1. Elecrodes
   
    Dry Electrodes: Easier to use, no gel needed, but less sensitive.
   
    Wet Electrodes: Require conductive gel, generally more accurate.
   
  
3. Amplifiers

    EEG signals are very weak (~Î¼V range) , low-noise amplifiers to boost the signal are required.
   
  
5. Filters

   To remove noise (e.g., 50/60 Hz power line interference), you'll need bandpass filters to isolate the EEG frequency bands

  
6. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

   EEG signals are analog, so you'll need an ADC to convert them into digital form for processing.

  
7. Microcontroller or Single-Board Computer
  
   ESP32: For embedded systems.
   
  
8. Power Supply

   Stable power source to avoid introducing noise into the system.
