# NeuraVis
The project aims to utilize Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor, analyze, and interpret brainwave activity for applications in neuroscience, mental health, and human-computer interaction. 
# Hardware indeed

1. Electrodes

     Dry electrodes are easier to use, while wet electrodes require gel but provide more accuracy.

2. Amplifiers

     EEG signals are very weak (~Î¼V range); low-noise amplifiers are needed to boost the signal.

3. Filters

     To remove noise (e.g., 50/60 Hz power line interference), bandpass filters are required.

4. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

     EEG signals are analog, so an ADC is necessary to convert them into digital form for proces  sing.

5. Microcontroller or Single-Board Computer

     ESP32 is used for embedded systems.

6. Power Supply

     A stable power source is essential to avoid introducing noise into the system.
